\titlenotes

\titlebackground{This article is based on a mixed-methods, multiple case study of five teams that participated in a large scale corporate hackathon in which two teams were “preexisting” teams (PETs) and three were newly-formed “flash” teams (FTs). This study provides a comprehensive understanding of team processes, conditions under which the projects were sustainable, and a broad array of outcomes of a corporate hackathon.}
